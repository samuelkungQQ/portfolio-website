Her journey reflects a complex relationship with addiction stemming from traumatic childhood events, including the loss of her parents and her time at an orphanage where she was introduced to tranquilizers. Over time, Beth developed dependencies on both tranquilizers and alcohol, severely impacting her career, relationships, and mental health.\n\nKey Details\n\nEarly Trauma: Beth’s mother’s suicide and life in an orphanage shaped her psychological vulnerability.\n\nIntroduction to Substances: At the orphanage, Beth hoarded tranquilizers (a fictional drug called xanzolam) and used them to enhance her focus on chess.\n\nProgression of Addiction:\n\nDependency escalated with the addition of alcohol, introduced by her adoptive mother.\n\nSubstance use became a coping mechanism during personal and professional failures."

    "text": "Literature Review\n\nOverview of Attachment Theory\nAttachment theory, proposed by John Bowlby, highlights the biological predisposition of infants to form attachments that ensure survival and foster emotional security. Ainsworth’s Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) provided empirical evidence for this theory, categorizing attachment into secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-ambivalent, and insecure-disorganized styles.\n\n\nAttachment and Exploration\nSecure attachment, through the concept of the caregiver as a “secure base,” facilitates exploration by reducing fear and promoting confidence. Research demonstrates that securely attached children exhibit more advanced exploratory behaviors, such as problem-solving and symbolic play, compared to their insecurely attached peers.\n\n\nGaps in the Literature\nWhile the benefits of secure attachment for exploration are well-documented, the situational effects of caregiver presence remain underexplored. This study addresses these gaps by examining exploratory behaviors in securely and insecurely attached children under different conditions."
