## Key Objectives

1. **Analyze spatial patterns**: Identify neighborhoods with high bike theft incidence.  
2. **Examine temporal dynamics**: Study when bike thefts are most likely to occur.  
3. **Provide recommendations**: Suggest strategies for individuals and authorities to mitigate bike theft risks.

## Data and Methods

### Data Source
- **Dataset**: Toronto bike theft dataset, as reported to Toronto Police Service.  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - **Neighborhoods**: Areas in Toronto with varying theft frequencies.  
  - **Premises Type**: Categories such as outdoor, apartments, and commercial locations.  
  - **Timeframe**: Grouped into hourly ranges.  
  - **Bike Type and Cost**: Includes categories like regular and mountain bikes, analyzed by cost range.  

### Methodology
- **Data Visualization**: Heatmaps and bar charts to highlight theft hotspots and trends.  
- **Categorical Analysis**: Examining the role of neighborhood, bike type, cost, premises type, and time of theft in shaping theft patterns.

## Results  

### High-Risk Neighborhoods
- **Top Neighborhoods**:  
  - Waterfront Communities – The Island, Bay Street Corridor, and Church–Yonge Corridor report the highest theft rates, exceeding 2,000 cases.  
  - Other high-risk areas include Niagara, Annex, and Kensington–Chinatown.  

### Premises and Time of Theft
- **Premises Type**: Outdoor areas and apartments exhibit the highest theft occurrences.  
- **Peak Hours**:  
  - Theft is most frequent between 12 PM to 11 PM, coinciding with peak activity times.  
  - Least theft activity is observed between 12 AM to 5 AM, aligning with lower public activity.  

### Bike Types and Costs
- **High-Risk Categories**:  
  - Regular bikes priced at $401–$650 and mountain bikes priced at $101–$400 are most prone to theft.  

### Divisions for Reporting Theft
- **Top Divisions**:  
  - D52, D14, and D51 have the highest number of reported cases, each exceeding 5,000.  
  - Recovery rates are low, with over 98% of bikes reported as stolen.

## Policy Implications  

1. **Urban Safety Enhancements**:  
   - Increase surveillance in high-risk neighborhoods.  
   - Improve bike parking infrastructure with secure locking mechanisms.  

2. **Public Awareness Campaigns**:  
   - Educate residents about high-risk areas and bike types.  
   - Promote usage of advanced locking systems and GPS tracking devices.  

3. **Law Enforcement Strategies**:  
   - Deploy targeted patrols during peak theft hours in hotspots.  
   - Collaborate with community organizations to monitor and reduce thefts.

## Limitations and Future Directions  

### Limitations
- **Underreporting Bias**: Unreported cases may skew the data.  
- **Spatial Granularity**: Analysis is limited to neighborhood and division-level data.  

### Future Research
- Explore additional factors such as weather, traffic density, and socio-economic indicators.  
- Incorporate GIS tools for detailed spatial analysis.
